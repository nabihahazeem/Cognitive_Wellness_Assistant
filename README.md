Cognitive Wellness Assistant

A data-integrated web application designed for structured behavioral wellness assessments. The platform combines client-side statistical analysis of mental health datasets with Large Language Model (LLM) orchestration to provide evidence-based lifestyle insights.

Core Technical Features:
-> Data-Driven Middleware: Implements a "Smart Response" layer that intercepts user input to perform real-time statistical comparisons against a mental health dataset before invoking generative AI.

-> LLM Orchestration: Leverages the Gemini 2.5 Flash API via a structured multi-stage system prompt to conduct non-linear wellness evaluations.

-> Statistical Analysis: Processes Sleep-to-Stress correlations, age-group mapping, and lifestyle trend analysis using PapaParse for high-performance CSV processing.

-> Robust Architecture: Features an asynchronous messaging pipeline with exponential backoff retry logic and a responsive, teal-themed UI built with Tailwind CSS.

-> Safety Layer: Prioritizes a hardcoded Safety Protocol to identify crisis intent and immediately redirect users to emergency resources.
